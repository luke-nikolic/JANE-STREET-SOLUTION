# Introduction

This project implements a pathfinding algorithm that utilizes **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in conjunction with an integer constraint satisfaction algorithm to find specific paths on a 6x6 grid that follow a chess knight's movements. The algorithm determines integer values for variables $A$, $B$, and $C$ under the constraint $A + B + C < 50$, such that the total score of the path equals a specified target of $2024$. The scoring system is based on custom rules that involve arithmetic operations depending on the sequence of moves and the values of the cells traversed.
